                  In 1945, <b>Castro</b> began studying law at the University of Havana.<br>
                  Admitting he was "politically illiterate", Castro became<br>
                   embroiled in student activism and the violent gangsterismo<br>
                    culture within the university. He unsuccessfully campaigned<br>
                     for the presidency of the Federation of University Students<br>
                     on a platform of "honesty, decency and justice".

                      by veteran politician Eduardo Chibas. In that same year, being the President of the <br>

                  <strong>March, 1952-Batista seizes power</strong><br>
                  On 10 March 1952, Batista seized power in a military coup, with Prío fleeing<br>
                   to Mexico. Declaring himself president, Batista cancelled the planned presidential <br>
                   elections, describing his new system as "disciplined democracy"; <b>Castro</b><br>
                    was deprived of being elected in his run for office by Batista's move,<br>
                     and like many others, considered it a one-man dictatorship. Batista moved to<br>
                      the right, solidifying ties with both the wealthy elite and the United <br>
                      States, severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, suppressing trade<br>
                       unions and persecuting Cuban socialist groups. Intent on opposing Batista, Castro <br>
                       brought several legal cases against the government, but these came to nothing,<br>
                        and Castro began thinking of alternate ways to oust the regime.

                  <strong>1953-1955- Imprisonment, Release and Flight from Cuba</strong><br>
                         <b>Castro</b> found fimself in prison after a failed attempt to attac the Moncada<br>
                         Barracks in its fight against Batista's government. Upon release from prison in 1955<br>
                         and having closely studies the political arena, he fled from Cuba amidst bombings and <br>
                         violent demonstrations against decent.

                    <strong>1956- Return to Cuba</strong><br>
                          After some time outside the country, <b>Castro</b> returned to the country to start a <br>
                          guerilla war with Batista's government. He was able to fight Batista out of power.

                          <b>Fidel</b> Castro was sworn in as Prime Minister of Cuba.

                    <strong>1960- Alignment</strong><br>
                            During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, Castro was aligned<br>
                            to and in support of the USSR. This is in line with his philosophy as<br>
                             a Marxist, a Socialist and a Leninist (Marxist-Leninist).
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>1961-Bay of Pigs Invasion</strong><br>
                         The CIA of the USA conducted this invasion in Cuba, due to the unhealthy<br>
                          relationship between the USA and Cuba. This operation was defeated by <br>
                          Castro's forces and the victory against the US elevated Castro's <br>
                          prestige in the international community.

                    <strong>1968- Great Revolutionary Offensive</strong><br>
                          Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, Castro proclaimed what he called<br>
                          Great Revolutionary Offensive. In this offensive, he closed all remaining privately<br>
                          owned shops and businesses. Remember that he was a Socialist, a Marxist and a <br>
                          Leninist. This Great Revolution however led to economic stagnation and hardship.

                    <strong>1975-1979-Castro and African Liberation from Imperialism<br></strong>
                          <b>Fidel Castro</b> travelled through parts of Africa in an attempt to strengthen <br>
                          and improve both military and economic ties. He hated the activities of <br>
                          imperialist countries. In his view "Africa is the weakest link in the imperialist<br>
                          chain". He supplied the military intelligence and a lot of boots on the ground<br>
                          to assist Angolan President Agostinho Neto in the Angolan Civil War.

                  <li>
                    <strong>1991-2000- Special Period</strong><br>
                          With favourable trade from the Soviet bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that<br>
                          Cuba was entering a "Special Period in Time of Peace". Petrol rations were<br>
                          dramatically reduced, Chinese bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories<br>
                          performing non-essential tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors, firewood<br>
                          began being used for cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 <br>
                          hours a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open<br>
                           war, and that the country might have to resort to subsistence farming.<br>
                           <br>
                           In 1991, Havana hosted the Pan American Games, which involved construction of a <br>
                           stadium and accommodation for the athletes; Castro admitted that it was an<br>
                            expensive error, but it was a success for Cuba's government. Crowds regularly <br>
                            shouted "Fidel! Fidel!" in front of foreign journalists, while Cuba became<br>
                             the first Latin American nation to beat the U.S. to the top of the<br>
                              gold-medal table.

                    <strong>2006-2008 Stepping Down</strong><br>
                          Castro underwent surgery for intestinal bleeding, and on 31 July 2006, delegated<br>
                          his presidential duties to Raúl Castro. In February 2007, Raúl announced that <br>
                          Fidel's health was improving and that he was taking part in important issues of<br>
                           government. Commenting on Castro's recovery, U.S. President George W. Bush said:<br>
                            "One day the good Lord will take Fidel Castro away." Hearing about this, the atheist<br>
                             Castro replied: "Now I understand why I survived Bush's plans and the plans<br>
                              of other presidents who ordered my assassination: the good Lord protected me." <br>
                              <br>
                              In a February 2008 letter, Castro announced that he would not accept the <br>
                              positions of President of the Council of State and Commander in Chief at<br>
                               that month's National Assembly meetings, remarking, "It would betray my <br>
                               conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total<br>
                                devotion, that I am not in a physical condition to offer."

                  <li>
                    <strong>2008-2018-Final Years and Death</strong><br>
                          Following his retirement, Castro's health deteriorated; international press speculated<br>
                            that he had diverticulitis, but Cuba's government refused to corroborate this.<br>
                            He continued to interact with the Cuban people, published an opinion column titled<br>
                            "Reflections" in Granma, used a Twitter account, and gave occasional public lectures. <br>
                            In January 2009 Castro asked Cubans not to worry about his lack of recent news columns<br>
                           and failing health, and not to be disturbed by his future death. He continued<br>
                            meeting foreign leaders and dignitaries, and that month photographs were released<br>
                             of Castro's meeting with Argentine President Cristina Fernández.<br>
                             <br>
                             On 19 April 2011, Castro resigned from the Communist Party central<br>
                              committee, thus stepping down as First Secretary. Raúl was selected<br>
                               as his successor. Now without any official role in the country's <br>
                               government, he took on the role of an elder statesman. In March 2011,<br>
                                Castro condemned the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. <br>
                                In March 2012, Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba for three days,<br>
                                 during which time he briefly met with Castro despite the Pope's<br>
                                  vocal opposition to Cuba's government.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  In December 2014, Castro was awarded the Chinese Confucius Peace<br>
                                   Prize for seeking peaceful solutions to his nation's conflict with<br>
                                    the U.S. and for his post-retirement efforts to prevent nuclear war.
                                    <br>
                                    He did not meet with U.S. President Barack Obama on the latter's<br>
                                     visit to Cuba in March 2016, although sent him a letter stating that<br>
                                      Cuba "has no need of gifts from the empire". That April, he gave his<br>
                                       most extensive public appearance in many years when addressing<br>
                                        the Communist Party. Highlighting that he was soon to turn 90 years<br>
                                         old, he noted that he would die in the near future but urged those<br>
                                          assembled to retain their communist ideals. In September 2016,<br>
                                           Castro was visited at his Havana home by the Iranian President<br>
                                            Hassan Rouhani, and later that month was visited by Japanese<br>
                                             Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. In late October 2016, Castro met<br>
                                              with the Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa,<br>
                                               who became one of the last foreign leaders to meet him.<br>
                                               <br>
                                               Cuban state television announced that Castro had died on the night<br>
                                                of 25 November 2016. The cause of death was not disclosed.<br>
                                                 His brother, President Raúl Castro, confirmed the news in<br>
                                                  a brief speech: "The commander in chief of the Cuban <br>
                                                  revolution died at 22:29 [EST] this evening." Fidel Castro<br>
                                                   was cremated on 26 November 2016. A funeral procession<br>
                                                    travelled 900 kilometres along the island's central highway from<br>
                                                     Havana to Santiago de Cuba, tracing in reverse, the route <br>
                                                     of the "Freedom Caravan" of January 1959, and after nine days of<br> public mourning, his ashes were entombed in the<br>
                                                      Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba.
